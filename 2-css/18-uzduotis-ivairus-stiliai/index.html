        <p class="whiteBackgroundP">The aurora borealis and aurora australis have dazzled us in the night sky for
            centuries. Here’s what causes
            them—and why we’re seeing them more lately.</p>

            <p class="firstParagraph">Common in polar and sub-polar regions, auroras can sometimes be seen at lower latitudes, including recent
                dazzling displays as far south as Florida and England. If you live in the the contiguous United States,
                but
                it seems like you’ve been able to see auroras far more often than you normally would—well, you’re right.
                Here’s why.</p>
            <p>No matter how many times you see them, the northern lights, or aurora borealis—and their Southern
                Hemisphere
                equivalent, the aurora australis—are an ethereal, breathtaking sight. Dancing silently in Earth’s upper
                atmosphere, they form iridescent sheets of green and red (or sometimes blue and purple) light.</p>

            <h3>What are auroras, or the northern and southern lights?</h3>
            <p>Italian astronomer<a href="https://www.history.com/topics/inventions/galileo-galilei"> Galileo
                    Galilei,</a> coined the term aurora in 1619 after the Roman goddess
                of dawn—mistakenly believing it to be the reflection of sunlight off the atmosphere.</p>

            <p>In fact, both northern and southern lights are caused by the interaction of gases in Earth’s atmosphere
                with the<a

                    wind:</a> a stream of electrically charged particles, called ions, that shoot
                out from the
                sun in all directions.</p>

            <p>When the solar wind reaches Earth, it slams into the planet’s magnetic field, producing currents of
                charged particles that flow toward the poles. Some of the ions become trapped in a layer of the
                atmosphere
                called the<a href="https://www.swpc.noaa.gov/phenomena/ionosphere"> ionoshere,</a> where they collide
                with gas atoms—primarily oxygen and nitrogen—and
                "excite" them
                with
                extra energy. This energy then gets released as particles of light, or<a
